==== IMPORTANT MESSAGE, PLEASE READ IT ====

The NIC (Network Interface Card) installed on the RaspberryPi2 board doesn't
have an ethernet MAC address burned in, that means after every reboot you get a
completely different and random MAC address (and thus, probably, a
different ip address too).
So, if you want to set a fixed mac address, stop the board at the uboot prompt,
and type:

setenv bootargs "$bootargs smsc95xx.macaddr=$MAC"
saveenv
boot

where $MAC is a valid ethernet MAC address
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address).
